## Graphs

### nomenclature

What is a graph?

> A **graph** is a set of **vertices** plus a set of **edges** that connect pairs
> of distinct vertices.
from Algorithms in C Part 5

**V** = number of vertices
**E** = number of edges

**path** = sequence of adjacent vertices
**cycle** = a path that start and end vertices are the same

TODO: **sparse** vs **dense**

### representations

*adjacency-matrix*

*adjacency-list*

more common.
